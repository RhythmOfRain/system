编译的时候添加选项-Wl,-z,norelro

Partial RELRO
compiler command line: gcc -Wl,-z,relro
the ELF sections are reordered so that the ELF internal data sections (.got, .dtors, etc.) precede the program's data sections (.data and .bss)
non-PLT GOT is read-only
GOT is still writeable

Full RELRO
compiler command line: gcc -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now
supports all the features of partial RELRO
bonus: the entire GOT is also (re)mapped as read-only
